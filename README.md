# Optimization-Stochastic-mathematical-modeling

This GAMS implementation represents a simplified and small-scale version of the
stochastic mathematical model presented in:

Ahmadi et al. (2024), *Optimizing urban bike-sharing systems: a stochastic mathematical
model for infrastructure planning*, Central European Journal of Operations Research.

The purpose of this implementation is to illustrate the structure of the formulation,
including network design decisions, capacity constraints, scenario-based demand, and
risk-averse modeling. Parameter values and network size are intentionally reduced for
clarity and reproducibility.
